A project description is a high-level overview of why you’re doing a project. The document explains a project’s objectives and its essential qualities. Think of it as the elevator pitch that focuses on what and why without delving into how.
You typically draft a project description early on, during the project initiation phase of the project management lifecycle.
The project manager often writes the project description. However, if you are working for an agency that seeks grant funding or writing a research proposal, you might need to learn how to write a project description in a project proposal.
The tricky part is figuring out what doesn’t belong in the project description. The description should focus on goals, objectives, and the overall approach, but you don’t need to include lists of tasks, an extensive background, or research analysis. In general, the project description is broad; you’ll include more detail in the project plan.

A project description is a high-level overview of why you’re doing a project. The document explains a project’s objectives and its essential qualities. Think of it as the elevator pitch that focuses on what and why without delving into how.
You typically draft a project description early on, during the project initiation phase of the project management lifecycle.
The project manager often writes the project description. However, if you are working for an agency that seeks grant funding or writing a research proposal, you might need to learn how to write a project description in a project proposal.
The tricky part is figuring out what doesn’t belong in the project description. The description should focus on goals, objectives, and the overall approach, but you don’t need to include lists of tasks, an extensive background, or research analysis. In general, the project description is broad; you’ll include more detail in the project plan.
